- 🥷 Hi, I’m Chris. I'm a dude from Portland, OR that spends a lot of time at concerts and playing live music. I like supporting websites that donate `time || energy || money` to `reforestation projects || wildlife preservation`. I am often caught thinking, writing, or talking about the problems that exist in the natural world. I'd like to think we can spend more time solving those problems. My hope is that I can lend a hand.
